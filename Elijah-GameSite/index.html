<p> Pac-Man, stylized as PAC-MAN, is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in May 1980. It was created by Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani.</p>
<p> The objective of Pac-Man is to eat as many white balls as possible without being caught by the blue minions. </p>
<p> Pac-Man is a rather addicting game, and although it is now generic, Pac-man was without a doubt the most popular video game for it's fair share of time.</p>
